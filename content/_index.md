Research Methods Workshops
==========================

-   Instructor: [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net)
-   Course detail: UNSW masters psychology (clinical & forensic)
-   Course dates: Term 1-3, 2021

For the most part [course materials](/materials) take the form of slides, pre-recorded YouTube videos, and some exercises that students can undertake at your own pace. Every Monday, from 10am to 2pm, I will be running "office hours" in which you can arrange drop in on campus for a face to face meeting (subject to whatever covid rules are in effect at the time), or chat with me on slack. I've found that this structure works a little better than trying to run lectures in zoom! The [assessment](/assessment) is based around short exercises, one associated with each workshop
