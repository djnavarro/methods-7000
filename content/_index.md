Research Methods Workshops
==========================

-   Instructor: [Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net)
-   Course detail: UNSW masters psychology (clinical & forensic)
-   Course dates: Term 1-3, 2021

For the most part [course materials](/materials) take the form of slides, pre-recorded YouTube videos, and some exercises that students can undertake at your own pace. Every Monday, from 10am to 2pm, I will be running "office hours" in which you can arrange drop in on campus for a face to face meeting (subject to whatever covid rules are in effect at the time), or chat with me on slack. I've found that this structure works a little better than trying to run lectures in zoom! The [assessment](/assessment) is based around short exercises, one associated with each workshop

The original plan...
--------------------

The original play, before we realised the 2021 class would be so small was roughly as follows.

-   Organising and structuring a project (Danielle Navarro)
-   Documenting and archiving a project (Danielle Navarro)
-   Thinking critically about scientific papers (Danielle Navarro)
-   Statistics without SPSS, part 1 (Danielle Navarro)
-   Statistics without SPSS, part 2 (Danielle Navarro)
-   Signal detection theory (James Dunn)
-   Introduction to meta-analysis (TBA)
-   Writing literature reviews (TBA)

I've left this up as a tentative guide for discussion in 2022, but for the purposes of the 2021 class, check the [course materials](/materials) page! ðŸ˜„
